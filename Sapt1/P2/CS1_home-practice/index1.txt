My week testing ADT's new contract-free security cameras was a total mess

ADT, a home security company that sells cameras, sensors and other devices under contract for a monthly fee, launched a DIY (i.e. no contract) spin-off brand back in January. The new company, dubbed Blue by ADT, is an extension of ADT's 2019 acquisition of DIY security brand LifeShield. Together, LifeShield's home security systems and Blue by ADT's cameras, range extender/doorbell chime and other upcoming accessories are supposed to act as self-installed, contract-free alternatives to ADT's standard, service-oriented home security offering.
