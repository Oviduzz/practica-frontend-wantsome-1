iPhone 9 (aka iPhone SE 2): Apple's budget iPhone needs to be small and affordable

The iPhone SE from 2016 was Apple's first budget phone and a new version of it called the iPhone 9 or iPhone SE 2 might be coming out this spring. The timing couldn't come any sooner, since rumors of an iPhone SE 2 have been percolating for a couple of years. That's because back when the original iPhone SE was announced, it was a huge surprise. It came out six months after the launch of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus with similar specs, but had the call-back looks of the beautifully blocky iPhone 5S. When the iPhone SE went on sale, Apple had trouble keeping up with the demand.
