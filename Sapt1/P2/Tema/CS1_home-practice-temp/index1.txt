Galaxy Z Flip ongoing review: Samsung's glass screen, crease and battery life so far

Samsung's new foldable phone is the cheapest foldable phone in market that we've used. Here's everything good and bad so far.

Spending a day with the Galaxy Z Flip  is like submerging yourself in a mud bath for the first time. You have strong immediate thoughts, but you know it's going to take a little while to get used to. Samsung gave professional phone reviewers like me a mere 24 hours with the novel device -- enough to form a cursory opinion, but not long enough to make a final assessment on the incredibly exciting and novel features that this foldable phone design brings.
