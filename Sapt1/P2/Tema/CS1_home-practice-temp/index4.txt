Google Doodle celebrates Susan B. Anthony's 200th birthday

Google is celebrating the 200th birthday of women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony and the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in the US with its latest Doodle, which went live on the search engine's homepage Friday. 

Anthony fought for women's right to vote in the US and is one of the most notable figures of the women's suffrage movement. She was born Feb. 15, 1820, in Massachusetts, and became interested in social change after meeting abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison. In 1851, she met reformer Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and together they advocated for women's rights.
