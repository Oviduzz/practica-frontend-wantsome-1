Disney Plus: Everything to know about Disney's Netflix rival

Disney's streaming service, Disney Plus, was one of last year's biggest launches -- one media analyst even called it "one of the greatest product launches of all time." Designed to take on Netflix and an emerging crop of rivals like Peacock, Apple TV Plus and HBO Max, Disney Plus is the entertainment giant's online hub to stream almost everything it produces. That means Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and all the family-friendly movies and animation from Disney itself, plus newly acquired favorites like The Simpsons.
